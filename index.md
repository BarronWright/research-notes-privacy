# Privacy Policy for [Extension Name]

Last updated: [YYYY-MM-DD]

## Overview
[Extension Name] helps users save highlighted text from webpages as research notes with source information and citations, and optionally export notes to third-party services (e.g., Notion, Google Docs) when the user requests.

We take privacy seriously. This extension is designed to be **local-first**: notes are stored on your device unless you choose to export them.

## Data We Collect
The extension may store the following data **locally in your browser**:
- Selected text you choose to save (highlights/quotes)
- Page metadata needed for citations (page title, URL, site/domain, access date)
- Optional user-entered fields (tags, project name, personal notes)
- Settings (default citation style, export template, export configuration)

## Data We Do Not Collect
We do **not**:
- Sell or rent user data
- Track browsing history
- Collect analytics or behavioral tracking by default
- Collect personally identifying information unless you explicitly provide it (e.g., by entering tokens/settings)

## How Data Is Used
Data is used only to:
- Create and display your saved notes
- Generate citation text from the saved source metadata
- Export notes when you click an export action

## Data Sharing
The extension shares data **only when you initiate an export**:
- If you export to Notion or Google Docs, the content you choose to export is sent to those services’ APIs.
- The extension does not share data with advertisers or unrelated third parties.

## Storage and Retention
- Notes and settings are stored locally using browser storage.
- You can delete notes at any time within the extension, which removes them from local storage.

## Permissions Explanation
The extension may request the following permissions:
- **activeTab / host access**: to read the selected text and page metadata on the page you are using when you trigger “Save highlight.”
- **contextMenus**: to provide a right-click menu item for saving highlights.
- **scripting**: to run the capture logic on demand after user action.
- **storage**: to save your notes and settings locally.

## Security
We do not execute remote code. All extension code is packaged with the extension. Network requests (if enabled) are only used for user-initiated export actions.

## Changes
We may update this policy as the extension evolves. The “Last updated” date will reflect changes.
